queue:
* change time turners to be located on the islands: when you touch them, you gain the turns
* move animals into the water, and have them be non-collectable (sea monsters)
* discrete islands

bugs:
* sometimes there is only one watermass and/or landmass
* sometimes the game doesn't start, which i think happens when there isn't enough land to place all the critters on

todo:
* cities
* probably will need islands to be discrete things, so we can designate how many cities are on each island and/or count the number of islands visited
* game mechanics
  * supplies
  * levels
* player character should change from ship on sea to adventurer on land (use https://kenney.nl/assets/sports-pack for character)
* make a README
* remove unused space naturalist code:
  * inventory?
* asset credits
  * https://kenney.nl/assets/pirate-pack
  * https://kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts
* UI elements: https://kenney.nl/assets?q=ui
* start adjacent to land
* skin islands differently

polish:
* ship animations
* fog of war/FOV
  * once fog is implemented, consider having more columns and rows with smaller cells
* different terrain on islands
* achievements
* music
* sfx
* vim keys
* include person graphic on ship
* cities as interstitials
* supplies countdown gets red, maybe even red screen or screen shake
